# Week7

Got to localhost /river for the Initial page.

You will be able to enter as many rivers as you want, then, on the results page when you click the display button it will populate a table with all of the rivers you have added.

Styling is a mixture of CSS template and Bootstrapping.  More research and trialling is needed for both.
